# dvproject
Couldn't spare time to work on the projects because of midterms and researches.
I decided to use a few big datasets instead of that python package, to get expereince working on big data.
So projects progress almost stopped, since I spend most of the time experimenting:
1 - Data visulation
2 - Working on enormous datasets.
